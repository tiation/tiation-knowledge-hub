## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Administrators
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Regularly review user access and permissions
- Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity
- Keep the application and dependencies updated
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Never commit sensitive environment variables to version control:
```bash
# Use .env files (excluded from git)
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-db-password-here
```

### Database Security
